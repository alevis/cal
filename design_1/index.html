            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>

            Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. WOrks in te Civilian Conservation
            Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All this left scars on me."</li>

            <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts.
            Inspirired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school to study under Stakman, who teaches him about
            breeding pest - resistant plants.</li>
            <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected.
            Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disenfectants, and
            other applied science.</li>
            <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology.</li>
            <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and
            flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6000
            different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on
            Earth.</li>
            <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields.</li>
            <li><strong>1953</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding American
            breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
            <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the indian
            subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population.</li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - Receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li><strong>1983</strong> - Help seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum
            yields.</li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> - Becomes a distringuished professor at Texas A&M University.</li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that
            genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that
            GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a
            long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
